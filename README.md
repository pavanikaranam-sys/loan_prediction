# Email Spam Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This machine learning project that can predict whether a loan application will be approved based on customer details.

## âœ… Steps Performed

1. **Data Collection**  
   Loaded the dataset (`load_pred.csv`) containing email features and labels.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for null values  
   - Handled outliers using the IQR method
   - Encoded columns like person_gender,previous_loan_defaults_on_file using label encoder and person_education,person_home_ownership,loan_intent using get_dummies

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Used box plots and histograms to explore distributions 

4. **Feature engineering**
   - Removed unnecessary features like `loan_status`
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets

5. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Used **Random Forest Classification** with `class_weight='balanced'`  
   - Evaluated the model with classification metrics and a confusion matrix
   - Achieved a classification accuracy of **~93%**, with:
       - High precision and recall for approved applications
       - Balanced model avoiding overfitting
